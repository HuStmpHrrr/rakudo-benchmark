# rakudo-benchmark
A bunch of snippets to test out the performance of rakudo and comparison to similar implementation in other languages

for fairness, codes are all tested in free VM in [Koding](koding.com). rakudo will be using Moar as backend, and stick to the latest version.

Each folder contains various implementation in single language.

Implementation cares about the form of similarity, without considering complexity.
